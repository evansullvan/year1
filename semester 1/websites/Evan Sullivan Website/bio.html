    <h2>My Biography</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Waterford, Ireland</h3>
    <h4>2005</h4>
    <p>in 2005 i started primary school, in waterford. the school was called christ-church-national-school. most of my days consisted of going to the park or playing games in class during my 8 years in this school, i had grown from a toddler who didnt know
        how to speak write... well i didnt know anything.
    </p>
    <h4>2012</h4>
    <p>my last days of primary school were fun, we spent the day at the park (yes the full 8 hours). i had just discoved facebook, and had to immediatly make an account on it. (my parents found out and they hated it!).
    </p>
    <h4>2013</h4>
    <p>I started into first year of newtown. we were all hearded into a hall for something called "collect". This was a time for reflection and SILENCE!, which obviously my friends and i were not used to... we spent the next 30mins holding in our laughter,
        laughter from nothing. I still dont actually recall what we were laughing at but we seemed to attract alot of attention. Our first class was a bit scary as it was maths. The first thing our teacher, when we got into the room, was to give out to
        us. Again, I have no idea what for.secomdary school went quite quick and after a few years it was time to do my leaving cert...
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>2020</h4>
    <p> corona virus hits the country and everthing is locked down. we are told that the school has to shut down for 2 weeks and no longer. weeks turned into to months, and it didnt help that our online classes didnt really happen. and in june the leaving
        cert was canceled, there would no exam at the end of the year and we were to get calculated grades, im sure you know the whole story by now. anyway i recieve my points and i get an offer from WIT and i accept.
