    <h2>Art</h2>

    <p>Ever since i was young, i have always been into drawing. i started with simple 3d objects in senior infants, until i discovered portraits.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Everyday i would <em>draw</em> this same portrait over and over again, my class mates obviously thought i belonged in a mental hospital... it was a face of a zombie. </p>
    <br>
    <p>once i was old enough enough to have a phone, i spent everyday researching new techniques to create the most life like portraits.</p>
